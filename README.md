# Netflix Movies Exploratory Data Analysis

This Python code analyses Netflix movie data by performing the following tasks:

1. Importing necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.
2. Read the Netflix data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
3. Filtering the DataFrame to include only movies.
4. Selecting relevant columns such as title, country, genre, release year, and duration.
5. Filtering movies with a duration shorter than 60 minutes.
6. Assigning colors to movies based on their genres (Children, Documentaries, Stand-Up, and others).
7. Creating a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between movie duration and release year.
8. Answering the question "Are movies getting shorter?" with a simple "no".

## Future Improvements

1. Incorporate more advanced statistical analysis techniques.
2. Enhance visualization by exploring different plot types and styles.
3. Expand the analysis to include TV shows and other content types available on Netflix.
